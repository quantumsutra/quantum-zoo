    "  * **Type**: Algorithmic Primitive / Basis Transformation.\n",
    "  * **Speedup Class**: **Exponential**.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **2. Introduction & Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **The \"Elevator Pitch\"**: The QFT is the quantum analogue of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Just as the classical Fourier transform translates a musical signal from \"time\" (amplitude at each moment) to \"frequency\" (pitch), the QFT translates a quantum state from the **computational basis** ($|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle$) to the **Fourier basis**. Crucially, it allows a quantum computer to detect **periodicity** (repeating patterns) in the amplitudes of a superposition exponentially faster than any classical method.\n",
    "  * **Real-World Use Cases**: You rarely run QFT by itself. Instead, it is the critical subroutine for:\n",
    "      * **Shor's Algorithm**: To extract the period of modular exponentiation.\n",
    "      * **Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)**: To find the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian.\n",
    "      * **Quantum Arithmetic**: For performing addition and multiplication in the Fourier basis.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **3. Deep Theoretical Dive 🧠**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The Mathematical Transformation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The QFT acts on a quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} x_j |j\\rangle$ and maps it to a new state $|y\\rangle = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} y_k |k\\rangle$, where the amplitudes $y_k$ are the discrete Fourier transform of the amplitudes $x_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformation is defined by the map on the basis states:\n",
    "$$|j\\rangle \\xrightarrow{QFT} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\omega_N^{jk} |k\\rangle$$\n",
    "where $\\omega_N = e^{2\\pi i / N}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The \"Product Representation\" (The Circuit Intuition)**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we blindly implemented the matrix multiplication above, it would be exponential. The secret to the exponential speedup lies in factoring the state. For $N=2^n$, the QFT state can be written as a tensor product of single qubits:\n",
    "$$QFT|j\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\left(|0\\rangle + e^{2\\pi i (0.j_n)}|1\\rangle\\right) \\otimes \\dots \\otimes \\left(|0\\rangle + e^{2\\pi i (0.j_1 j_2 \\dots j_n)}|1\\rangle\\right)$$\n",
    "*Note: $(0.j_1 j_2 \\dots)$ represents a binary fraction $\\frac{j_1}{2} + \\frac{j_2}{4} + \\dots$.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation tells us that the QFT is actually just a sequence of **rotations** on individual qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The Circuit Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "The circuit is built using two gates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Hadamard Gate ($H$)**: Creates the superposition $|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle$.\n",
    "2.  **Controlled-Phase Gate ($CROT_k$ or $CP(\\theta)$)**: Adds a relative phase depending on the state of another qubit.\n",
    "    $$CP(\\theta) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & e^{i\\theta} \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Protocol**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Apply $H$ to qubit 1.\n",
    "2.  Apply $CP(\\pi/2)$ from qubit 2 to qubit 1.\n",
    "3.  Apply $CP(\\pi/4)$ from qubit 3 to qubit 1... up to qubit $n$.\n",
    "4.  Repeat for qubit 2, then qubit 3, etc.\n",
    "5.  **SWAP**: The result of this process outputs the bits in reversed order, so a series of SWAP gates is added at the end to correct the bit order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Practical Advantage & Complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Quantum Complexity**: The circuit requires $n$ Hadamard gates and $n(n-1)/2$ controlled-phase gates. Total depth: $O(n^2)$.\n",
    "  * **Classical Complexity**: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) requires $O(n 2^n)$ operations.\n",
    "  * **The \"Gotcha\"**: You cannot read out the full vector of Fourier coefficients $y_k$ from the quantum state efficiently. Measuring the state collapses it to a *single* random sample $|k\\rangle$ with probability $|y_k|^2$.\n",
    "  * **Why it's still useful**: We don't usually need the full spectrum. In algorithms like Shor's, the output is structured so that the measurement outcome $|k\\rangle$ is highly likely to be the specific frequency we are looking for (the period).\n",

    "# Fundamental Primitive: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Algorithm Profile**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Name**: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)\n",
    "  * **Origin**: Developed by **Kitaev** (1995) and refined by **Cleve, Ekert, Macchiavello, and Mosca** (1998).\n",
    "  * **Type**: Algorithmic Primitive / Spectral Analysis.\n",
    "  * **Speedup Class**: **Exponential**. It can estimate the eigenvalue phase with precision $\\epsilon$ using $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ qubits, whereas classical methods often scale polynomially or exponentially in system size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Introduction & Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **The \"Elevator Pitch\"**: Imagine you have a black box (a quantum gate $U$) that changes the phase of a specific quantum state but leaves everything else alone. You want to know exactly *how much* it changes the phase. QPE allows a quantum computer to measure this hidden phase shift with arbitrary precision. It effectively converts \"phase information\" (which is usually unmeasurable directly) into \"amplitude information\" (which we can measure as bitstrings).\n",
    "  * **Real-World Use Cases**: QPE is the \"sledgehammer\" of quantum algorithms.\n",
    "      * **Shor's Algorithm**: Finds the phase $s/r$ to extract the period $r$.\n",
    "      * **HHL**: Finds eigenvalues $\\lambda$ to invert matrices.\n",
    "      * **Quantum Chemistry**: Estimates the energy of a molecule (ground state energy is an eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian).\n",
    "  * **Current Status**: It is a standard library function (`QuantumPhaseEstimation`) in Qiskit, Cirq, and other frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Deep Theoretical Dive 🧠**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a unitary operator $U$ and one of its eigenstates $|\\psi\\rangle$ such that:\n",
    "$$U|\\psi\\rangle = e^{2\\pi i \\theta} |\\psi\\rangle$$\n",
    "The goal is to estimate the phase **$\\theta$** (a value between 0 and 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The Quantum Mechanism: Phase Kickback & Interference**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm uses two registers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Counting Register**: $t$ qubits initialized to $|0\\rangle$. These will store the bits of the phase $\\theta$.\n",
    "2.  **Eigenstate Register**: Stores the eigenstate $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Process**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Superposition**: Apply Hadamard gates to the counting register to create a uniform superposition.\n",
    "2.  **Controlled Unitaries (Phase Kickback)**: This is the core mechanism. We apply a sequence of controlled-$U$ operations. Specifically, the $k$-th counting qubit acts as a control for the operation $U^{2^k}$.\n",
    "      * If the control is $|1\\rangle$, the target picks up a phase $e^{2\\pi i \\theta 2^k}$.\n",
    "      * This phase is \"kicked back\" to the control qubit.\n",
    "      * After this step, the state of the counting register is:\n",
    "        $$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^t}} \\sum_{k=0}^{2^t-1} e^{2\\pi i \\theta k} |k\\rangle$$\n",
    "3.  **Inverse QFT**: The state above is exactly the **Quantum Fourier Transform** of the value $2^t \\theta$. Applying the *Inverse* QFT ($QFT^\\dagger$) unravels this Fourier state back into the computational basis state representing the binary fraction of $\\theta$.\n",
    "4.  **Measurement**: Measuring the counting register yields an integer $y$. The estimate for the phase is $\\theta \\approx y / 2^t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Practical Advantage & Complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Quantum Complexity**: To get $n$ bits of precision with high probability, we need $t = n + \\lceil \\log(2 + \\frac{1}{2\\epsilon}) \\rceil$ qubits. The circuit depth is dominated by the controlled-$U$ operations.\n",
    "  * **The \"Eigenstate Problem\"**: The algorithm assumes we *have* the eigenstate $|\\psi\\rangle$. If we don't (e.g., in chemistry, we want to find the ground state), we prepare a guess $|\\psi_{guess}\\rangle$. The algorithm will then output the phase $\\theta_i$ with probability $|\\langle \\psi_i | \\psi_{guess} \\rangle|^2$.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will estimate the phase of a **T-gate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Unitary**: $T = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & e^{i\\pi/4} \\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "  * **Eigenstate**: $|1\\rangle$.\n",
    "  * **Eigenvalue**: $e^{i\\pi/4} = e^{2\\pi i (1/8)}$.\n",
