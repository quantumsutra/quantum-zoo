    "\n",
    "### 9. Learning a \"Consciousness Operator\"\n",
    "* **The Challenge**: Is there a single, global mathematical operator that corresponds to the \"measurement of consciousness\"? If so, finding this operator from observational data is a hopelessly complex inverse problem.\n",
    "* **Quantum Approach**: Frame the problem as learning a quantum observable. Use a **Variational Quantum Algorithm** to train a parameterized Hermitian operator $H$. The goal is to find the operator $H$ whose expectation value, $\\langle\\psi|H|\\psi\\rangle$, when applied to quantum states $|\\psi\\rangle$ representing brain activity, best correlates with externally reported conscious states (e.g., awake, asleep, anesthetized).\n",

    "\n",
    "### 10. Designing a Quantum BCI Sensor\n",
    "* **The Challenge**: This inverts the problem. Can we use our understanding of quantum mechanics to design a fundamentally new *type of sensor* for a BCI?\n",
    "* **Quantum Approach**: Use **Hamiltonian Simulation** to design a quantum sensor (like a Nitrogen-Vacancy center) that is engineered to be maximally sensitive to the specific biomagnetic fields produced by neural firing. This is a quantum design problem for a quantum device.\n",
