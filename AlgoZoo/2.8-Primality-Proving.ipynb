    "### 8. Primality Proving\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of primality proving asks for a definitive, verifiable certificate that a given number is prime. While probabilistic primality *testing* (like Miller-Rabin) is fast, it doesn't provide absolute proof. Quantum algorithms offer a polynomial speedup over the fastest known classical *proving* algorithms, demonstrating that quantum computers can accelerate even problems that are already considered classically tractable (i.e., in the complexity class **P**).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Complexity**: **Polynomial Speedup**\n",
    "    * **Quantum**: The fastest dedicated quantum algorithm runs in $\\tilde{O}(n^3)$ time (where $\\tilde{O}$ hides logarithmic factors), with potential improvements to $\\tilde{O}(n^2)$ [396, 399]. An earlier method based on factoring runs in $\\tilde{O}(n^{3.5})$ [397], with potential improvements to $\\tilde{O}(n^{2.5})$ [398].\n",
    "    * **Classical**: The breakthrough **AKS algorithm**, the first deterministic polynomial-time algorithm, runs in $\\tilde{O}(n^4)$ in its fastest versions [393, 394].\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Implementation Libraries**: As these are primarily theoretical results demonstrating complexity improvements, they are **not found in standard quantum libraries**.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Detailed Theory 🧠**\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the quantum speedup, it's essential to first distinguish between \"testing\" and \"proving\" and then to understand the two main quantum approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1: Primality Testing vs. Proving**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Primality Testing**: This is typically a probabilistic method. An algorithm like Miller-Rabin takes a number $N$ and a \"witness\" $a$. It performs a quick test. If the test fails, $N$ is definitely composite. If it passes, $N$ is *probably* prime. By repeating with many random witnesses, we can make the probability of being wrong astronomically small, but it's never zero. This is sufficient for many applications, like generating RSA keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Primality Proving**: This is a deterministic method. The algorithm provides a certificate that can be checked to verify that the number is, without a doubt, prime. The classical AKS algorithm and the quantum algorithms fall into this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2: Quantum Approach 1 - Proving via Factoring**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most straightforward, though not the fastest, quantum method. The logic is simple:\n",
    "* **A number $N$ is prime if and only if it has no integer factors other than 1 and itself.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "1.  Given an input integer $N$, run **Shor's factoring algorithm (Algorithm #1)** on it.\n",
    "2.  If Shor's algorithm returns a non-trivial factor, you have a definitive proof that $N$ is **composite**.\n",
    "3.  If Shor's algorithm, after being run a sufficient number of times to guarantee a high probability of success, fails to find any factors, you have a definitive proof that $N$ is **prime**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of this method is dominated by the runtime of Shor's algorithm. While Shor's is often described as $\\tilde{O}(n^2)$, turning it into a rigorous proof system with bounded error adds overhead, leading to the slightly higher complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 3: Quantum Approach 2 - The Donis-Vela & Garcia-Escartin Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach provides a better speedup by not relying on the full machinery of factoring. It instead accelerates the search for a specific type of primality proof known as a **Pocklington certificate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Classical Foundation (Pocklington's Criterion)**: A classical theorem by Pocklington provides a way to prove a number $N$ is prime. It requires finding a special number $a$ (a \"witness\") that satisfies two conditions:\n",
    "    $$a^{N-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod N$$   $$gcd(a^{(N-1)/q} - 1, N) = 1$$\n",
    "    ...for all prime factors $q$ of $N-1$. If such an $a$ exists, $N$ is prime. The classical difficulty is that you need to know the prime factors of $N-1$, and then you have to *find* an appropriate witness $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Quantum Speedup with Grover's Algorithm**: The Donis-Vela & Garcia-Escartin algorithm uses quantum computation to overcome the search problem.\n",
    "    * The algorithm requires a partial factorization of $N-1$. This can be done with classical methods or aided by quantum factoring for the more difficult parts.\n",
    "    * The main step is to find the witness $a$ that satisfies Pocklington's criterion. Classically, this involves trying many different values of $a$.\n",
    "    * The quantum algorithm constructs an oracle that checks if a given $a$ is a valid witness. It then uses **Grover's search algorithm** to find a suitable $a$ with only $O(\\sqrt{k})$ queries, where $k$ is the number of candidates a classical algorithm would need to check. This quadratic speedup in the search for a witness is the source of the overall polynomial speedup of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the algorithm combines a sophisticated classical number-theoretic criterion with a targeted quantum search to accelerate the discovery of the proof.\n",

    "### **Use Cases and Significance 🏛️**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cryptographic Certification**: While not strictly necessary for key generation, primality proofs are important in formal settings where a cryptographic primitive must be certified as secure. For example, standards might require a provably prime number, not just a probably prime one.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Speeding up Problems in P**: This algorithm is theoretically very important. Most famous quantum algorithms (like Shor's) provide exponential speedups for problems thought to be outside the classical class **P** (i.e., not solvable in polynomial time). This algorithm provides a polynomial speedup for a problem that is *already known to be in **P***. This shows that quantum computers aren't just for intractable problems; they can also provide meaningful speedups for problems we can already solve, making them faster and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **A Sophisticated Use of Grover's Algorithm**: It serves as a prime example of how Grover's search can be integrated as a core component within a larger, more complex algorithm. It's not just for searching a simple database; it can accelerate any computational process that has a \"search for a valid solution\" substructure.\n",
