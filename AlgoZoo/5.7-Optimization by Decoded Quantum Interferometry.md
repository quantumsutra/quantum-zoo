Here is the entry for the sixty-second algorithm. This entry describes a completely novel and powerful paradigm for quantum optimization, which works by transforming an optimization problem into a problem from the world of error-correcting codes.

### 62. Optimization by Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI)

**Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI)** is a unique and powerful hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for approximate optimization. Instead of iteratively searching for a solution like VQE or QAOA, DQI uses a quantum computer to perform a single, powerful transformation. It converts the complex landscape of an optimization problem into the familiar territory of an **error-correction decoding problem**, which a classical computer can then solve with highly optimized algorithms. For certain structured problems, this method can find better approximate solutions than are known to be possible classically, offering a potential superpolynomial speedup.

* **Complexity**: **Superpolynomial Speedup** (for certain structured problems).
* **Implementation Libraries**: As a novel and advanced paradigm, DQI is the subject of ongoing research.
    * **Classiq**: The Classiq platform provides modeling capabilities for this type of algorithm.

### **Detailed Theory 🧠**

DQI is a two-stage process that leverages the best of both quantum and classical computation.

**Part 1: The Core Idea - From Finding Solutions to Correcting Errors**

The genius of DQI is to reframe the optimization task.
1.  **The Goal**: We want to find an approximate solution to a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)**. We have a set of variables and a list of constraints, and we want to find an assignment that satisfies the maximum possible number of constraints.
2.  **The DQI Transformation**: The algorithm maps the problem to the language of **error-correcting codes**:
    * A perfect solution that satisfies all constraints is treated as an "error-free" **codeword**.
    * A candidate solution that violates some constraints is treated as a "corrupted" or **noisy codeword**.
    * The number of violated constraints corresponds to the number of "errors" that have been applied to the original codeword.
3.  **The New Problem**: The original optimization problem is now gone. It has been replaced by a decoding problem: "Given this noisy codeword, what was the most likely original, error-free codeword?"

**Part 2: The Quantum Step - The Interferometer**

The quantum computer's job is to perform this transformation. The "interferometry" in the name refers to the use of the **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)**, which relies on quantum interference.
1.  **Prepare Superposition**: The algorithm starts with a uniform superposition of all possible solutions to the CSP.
2.  **Encode the Cost**: An oracle is used to evaluate the "cost" (the number of violated constraints) for each solution in the superposition. This cost is encoded into the **phase** of each state. States corresponding to good solutions get one kind of phase, while states for bad solutions get another.
3.  **Apply the QFT**: The QFT is applied to this state. This is the core of the transformation. The QFT converts the information stored in the phases into a new superposition in the computational basis.
4.  **Measure**: A measurement of this final state yields a single classical bit string. This bit string is the **noisy codeword** that is passed to the next stage. The structure of the original problem's constraints determines the type of error-correcting code that is produced (e.g., local constraints might produce an LDPC code).



**Part 3: The Classical Step - The Decoder**

The output of the quantum computer is just the input for a powerful classical algorithm.
* **Classical Decoding**: This noisy codeword is fed into a highly efficient **classical decoding algorithm**.
* **Leveraging Classical Power**: This is a key strength of the DQI paradigm. The field of coding theory has developed incredibly powerful and fast decoders for structured codes like **LDPC codes** and **Reed-Solomon codes**.
* **The Final Solution**: The classical decoder corrects the errors and outputs the nearest valid codeword. This error-free codeword is then translated back into the language of the original problem, yielding a high-quality approximate solution.

**The Superpolynomial Speedup**: For certain problems, like finding the best-fit polynomial for a set of data over a finite field, DQI maps the problem to decoding a **Reed-Solomon code**. Classical Reed-Solomon decoders are so powerful they can correct a huge number of errors. This allows DQI to find an approximation to the polynomial that is far better than what is known to be achievable by any efficient classical optimization algorithm.

### **Significance and Use Cases 🏛️**

* **A New Hybrid Paradigm**: DQI represents a completely new way of thinking about hybrid quantum-classical computing. It is not an iterative loop like VQE/QAOA. Instead, it is a single-shot transformation where the quantum computer acts as a powerful pre-processor, changing the problem into a form that a classical computer is exceptionally good at solving.

* **Leveraging the Best of Both Worlds**: The method is powerful because it assigns the right task to the right machine. The quantum computer performs the complex Fourier transform that is classically hard, while the classical computer runs the highly optimized decoding algorithms that have been perfected over decades.

* **Structured Optimization**: The DQI approach is most promising for optimization problems that have a strong, regular underlying structure. This structure is what allows the problem to be mapped to a "good" error-correcting code with an efficient classical decoder.
