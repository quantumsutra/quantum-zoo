    "### 3. Pell's Equation (Hallgren's Algorithm)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hallgren's algorithm, developed in 2002 by Sean Hallgren, represents a significant theoretical advancement in quantum computation. It was one of the first major results to show that quantum computers could solve problems beyond the finite abelian Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP) framework used by Shor, extending the paradigm to continuous groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Complexity**: Superpolynomial Speedup\n",
    "    * **Quantum**: The algorithm finds the fundamental solution to Pell's equation in polynomial time with respect to the input size, $poly(\\log d)$ [49].\n",
    "    * **Classical**: No polynomial-time classical algorithm is known. The size of the fundamental solution itself can be exponential in $\\log d$, so simply writing it down can be intractable. The quantum algorithm efficiently finds a compact representation of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Implementation Libraries**: Implementations of Hallgren's algorithm are **not common** in standard quantum libraries like Cirq or Classiq. The algorithm is of immense theoretical importance but is more complex to realize than Shor's algorithm, involving a quantum Fourier transform over the real numbers, which is challenging to implement on gate-based hardware.\n",

    "### **Detailed Theory**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm tackles Pell's equation by reformulating it as a period-finding problem over the real numbers, which requires solving a continuous version of the Hidden Subgroup Problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's define **Pell's Equation**:\n",
    "For a given positive, non-square integer $d$, Pell's equation is the Diophantine equation:\n",
    "$$x^2 - dy^2 = 1$$\n",
    "We are looking for integer solutions $(x, y)$. There are infinitely many such solutions. The smallest positive integer solution $(x_1, y_1)$ is called the **fundamental solution**. All other solutions can be generated from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of $x_1$ and $y_1$ can be exponentially large in the number of bits of $d$. Therefore, the goal is not to find $x_1$ and $y_1$ directly, but to find the **regulator**, $R$, which is a compact representation of the solution:\n",
    "$$R = \\ln(x_1 + y_1\\sqrt{d})$$\n",
    "Once $R$ is known to sufficient precision, the fundamental solution can be efficiently recovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1: Reduction to a Period-Finding Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "The genius of Hallgren's algorithm lies in connecting Pell's equation to the algebraic structure of the quadratic number field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Ideals in a Quadratic Field**: The algorithm works with mathematical objects called *ideals* within the ring of integers of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$. An ideal can be thought of as a generalization of a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **A Periodic Function**: Hallgren constructed a special function $f$ that is periodic, where the period is exactly the regulator $R$. The function maps real numbers to ideals:\n",
    "    $$f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\{\\text{Ideals of } \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})\\}$$\n",
    "    The function has the property that $f(z_1) = f(z_2)$ if and only if $z_1 - z_2$ is an integer multiple of the regulator $R$. In other words, $R$ is the period of $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **The Hidden Subgroup Problem over** $\\mathbb{R}$: The problem is now to find the period $R$ of the function $f$. This is equivalent to finding the hidden subgroup $R\\mathbb{Z}$ within the continuous group $\\mathbb{R}$. This was a major departure from Shor's algorithm, which found hidden subgroups within finite groups like $\\mathbb{Z}_r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2: The Quantum Subroutine**\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum part of the algorithm is designed to find the period $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **State Preparation**: A quantum register is prepared in a superposition of values that represent a discrete approximation of a range of real numbers. These qubits serve as the input to the periodic function $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Compute the Function**: A quantum procedure computes the function $f(z)$, mapping the input superposition to an entangled state where each input is associated with a specific ideal. Measuring the output register (which stores a representation of the ideal) collapses the input register into a periodic superposition of states $|z_0 + kR\\rangle$, where $k$ is an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) over** $\\mathbb{R}$: This is the key technical challenge. Since the input register is a discrete approximation of a continuous variable, a standard QFT cannot be used. Instead, the algorithm uses a carefully constructed approximation of the QFT for the real numbers. This involves working with a finite number of qubits and managing the precision of the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Measurement and Post-Processing**: Measuring the state after the QFT yields, with high probability, an integer $m$ that is close to a multiple of the reciprocal of the period, $1/R$.\n",
    "    $$m \\approx \\frac{k}{R} \\text{ for some integer } k$$\n",
    "    Using the **continued fractions algorithm** on the measured value $m$ (scaled appropriately), we can extract a highly accurate rational approximation of $R$. The algorithm is run a few times to generate enough information to determine $R$ to the required precision.\n",

    "### **Use Cases and Significance**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cryptanalysis**: Hallgren's algorithm can efficiently break the **Buchmann-Williams cryptosystem**, a public-key system whose security relies on the difficulty of solving Pell's equation and the associated Principal Ideal Problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Theoretical Breakthrough**: The primary significance of the algorithm is its expansion of the power of quantum computing. It demonstrated that the Hidden Subgroup Problem could be solved even for continuous and infinite groups, a major generalization of Shor's work.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Foundation for Further Algorithms**: This breakthrough paved the way for a series of other quantum algorithms for problems in algebraic number theory, such as the Principal Ideal Problem, finding the Unit Group, and the Class Group of number fields. It showed that quantum computers could tackle a much broader class of mathematical problems than previously confirmed.\n",
