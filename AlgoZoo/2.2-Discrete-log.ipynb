    "\n",
    "The discrete logarithm problem is another foundational problem in number theory that is considered difficult for classical computers. Peter Shor's groundbreaking 1994 paper presented a quantum algorithm to solve not only factoring but also the discrete logarithm problem, leveraging the same core principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Complexity**: Superpolynomial Speedup\n",
    "    * **Quantum**: The algorithm runs in polynomial time, with a complexity similar to the factoring algorithm: $O((\\log N)^2 (\\log \\log N)(\\log \\log \\log N))$ [82].\n",
    "    * **Classical**: The best-known classical algorithm is the general number field sieve, which runs in sub-exponential time. For the related elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem, the best classical algorithms are fully exponential.\n",

    "### **Detailed Theory**\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum algorithm for the discrete logarithm problem is conceptually very similar to the one for factoring. It once again transforms the problem into a period-finding task that can be solved efficiently with the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's define the **Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP)**:\n",
    "Given a prime $p$, a generator $g$ of the multiplicative group of integers modulo $p$ (denoted $\\mathbb{Z}_p^*$), and an element $b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p^*$, find the integer $s$ such that:\n",
    "$$g^s \\equiv b \\pmod{p}$$\n",
    "The integer $s$ is the discrete logarithm of $b$ to the base $g$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum algorithm proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1: Defining a Periodic Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is to construct a function whose period encodes the unknown discrete logarithm $s$. We define a function of two variables, $f(x_1, x_2)$, over the group $\\mathbb{Z}_r \\times \\mathbb{Z}_r$, where $r = p-1$ is the order of the group $\\mathbb{Z}_p^*$:\n",
    "$$f(x_1, x_2) = g^{x_1} b^{-x_2} \\pmod{p}$$\n",
    "Substituting $b=g^s$, we get:\n",
    "$$f(x_1, x_2) = g^{x_1} (g^s)^{-x_2} = g^{x_1 - sx_2} \\pmod{p}$$\n",
    "This function is periodic. The period is a vector $(k_1, k_2)$ such that $f(x_1, x_2) = f(x_1+k_1, x_2+k_2)$. This condition is met if the exponent is congruent modulo $r$, the order of the group:\n",
    "$$(x_1 - sx_2) \\equiv (x_1+k_1) - s(x_2+k_2) \\pmod{r}$$\n",
    "$$0 \\equiv k_1 - sk_2 \\pmod{r} \\implies k_1 \\equiv sk_2 \\pmod{r}$$\n",
    "The algorithm aims to find a vector $(k_1, k_2)$ satisfying this relationship, which will allow us to solve for $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2: The Quantum Period-Finding Subroutine**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **State Preparation**: We use three quantum registers. The first two registers will hold the inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$, and the third will hold the output of the function. Let's say the first two registers each have $n$ qubits, where $2^n$ is large enough to hold numbers up to $r-1$. The state is initialized to a uniform superposition:\n",
    "    $$|\\psi_0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2^n} \\sum_{x_1=0}^{2^n-1} \\sum_{x_2=0}^{2^n-1} |x_1\\rangle |x_2\\rangle |0\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Compute the Function**: We apply a quantum operator that computes $f(x_1, x_2)$ and stores the result in the third register:\n",
    "    $$|\\psi_1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2^n} \\sum_{x_1=0}^{2^n-1} \\sum_{x_2=0}^{2^n-1} |x_1\\rangle |x_2\\rangle |g^{x_1}b^{-x_2} \\pmod{p}\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Measurement of the Third Register**: Measuring the third register causes the first two registers to collapse into a superposition of all pairs $(x_1, x_2)$ that yield the measured result. This state is periodic, defined by the relationship $k_1 \\equiv sk_2 \\pmod r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Quantum Fourier Transform**: We apply a 2-dimensional QFT to the first two registers. The 2D QFT is simply a QFT applied to the first register, followed by a QFT applied to the second register. This transforms the periodic superposition in the computational basis into a state where the probability amplitudes are sharply peaked at integer pairs $(c_1, c_2)$ that satisfy:\n",
    "    $$c_1 k_2 - c_2 k_1 \\approx 0 \\pmod{2^n}$$\n",
    "    Substituting the periodicity condition $k_1 \\equiv sk_2 \\pmod{r}$, we get:\n",
    "    $$c_1 k_2 - c_2 (sk_2) \\approx 0 \\pmod{2^n}$$\n",
    "    $$(c_1 - sc_2)k_2 \\approx 0 \\pmod{2^n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Measure the First Two Registers**: We measure the first two registers to obtain a pair of integers $(c_1, c_2)$. With high probability, this pair will satisfy the relationship $c_1 \\approx sc_2 \\pmod r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 3: Classical Post-Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the measurement results $(c_1, c_2)$, we now have the congruence:\n",
    "$$c_1 \\equiv sc_2 \\pmod{r}$$\n",
    "This is a linear congruence equation for the unknown $s$. We can solve it easily using the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse of $c_2$:\n",
    "$$s \\equiv c_1 \\cdot c_2^{-1} \\pmod{r}$$\n",
    "If $c_2$ does not have a modular inverse modulo $r$, or if the procedure fails for another reason, we can simply repeat the quantum algorithm to obtain a different pair $(c_1, c_2)$, which is very likely to succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Cases and Significance**\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to solve the discrete logarithm problem efficiently has profound consequences for modern digital security.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Breaking Key Exchange Protocols**: The **Diffie-Hellman key exchange** protocol, a cornerstone of secure communication on the internet (used in TLS/SSL, VPNs, etc.), bases its security directly on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. A quantum computer running Shor's algorithm could intercept the public values exchanged and compute the shared secret key, decrypting all communication. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Compromising Digital Signatures**: The **Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)** and the **Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)** also rely on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem (in the case of ECDSA, its elliptic-curve variant). A quantum computer could forge digital signatures, which would undermine the authenticity and integrity of digital documents, software updates, and financial transactions. Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use ECDSA to secure transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Advancing Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Just like with factoring, the threat posed by this algorithm is a primary motivator for the transition to post-quantum cryptographic standards that are not based on either the factoring or discrete logarithm problems.\n",
