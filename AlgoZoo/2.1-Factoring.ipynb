    "### 1. Factoring (Shor's Algorithm)\n",
    "\n",
    "Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for integer factorization, discovered by Peter Shor in 1994. It is arguably the most famous quantum algorithm due to its profound implications for cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Complexity**: Superpolynomial Speedup\n",
    "    * **Quantum**: The algorithm runs in polynomial time, specifically in $O((\\log N)^2 (\\log \\log N)(\\log \\log \\log N))$ time on a quantum computer, where $N$ is the integer to be factored [82, 125].\n",
    "    * **Classical**: The best-known classical algorithm is the general number field sieve, which runs in sub-exponential time, approximately $exp(O((\\log N)^{1/3} (\\log \\log N)^{2/3}))$. For large $N$, this is significantly slower than the quantum algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Implementation Libraries**:\n",
    "    * **Cirq**: Examples of Shor's algorithm are available in the Cirq library, demonstrating how to construct the quantum circuits for the order-finding subroutine. You can find these within the `examples/` directory of the [Cirq GitHub repository](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/tree/main/examples).\n",
    "    * **Classiq**: The Classiq platform provides a higher-level, functional approach to building quantum circuits. Their library contains implementations of Shor's algorithm that abstract away much of the gate-level complexity. You can explore these in the `algorithms/` section of the [Classiq library on GitHub](https://github.com/Classiq/classiq-library/tree/main/algorithms).\n",

    "### **Detailed Theory**\n",
    "\n",
    "Shor's algorithm cleverly transforms the hard problem of factoring an integer into the problem of finding the period of a function, which is a task a quantum computer can perform efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall structure of the algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1: Classical Reduction to Order-Finding**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $N$ be the large composite integer we wish to factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initial Check**: Perform a classical check to see if $N$ is even or a prime power. If $N$ is even, 2 is a factor. If $N=p^k$ for some prime $p$, we can find $p$ classically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Pick a Random Number**: Choose a random integer $a$ such that $1 < a < N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Compute GCD**: Calculate the greatest common divisor, $gcd(a, N)$. If $gcd(a, N) \\neq 1$, we have found a non-trivial factor of $N$, and we are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **The Order-Finding Problem**: If $gcd(a, N) = 1$, we now need to find the **order** (or period) $r$ of $a$ modulo $N$. The order $r$ is the smallest positive integer such that:\n",
    "    $a^r \\equiv 1 \\pmod{N}$\n",
    "    This is the computationally hard part that the quantum computer will solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Finding the Factors**: Once the quantum subroutine returns the order $r$, we check two conditions:\n",
    "    * Is $r$ even?\n",
    "    * Is $a^{r/2} \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod{N}$?\n",
    "\n",
    "    If both conditions are met, then we can find a non-trivial factor of $N$ by computing:\n",
    "    $p = gcd(a^{r/2} - 1, N)$ and $q = gcd(a^{r/2} + 1, N)$\n",
    "    This works because if $a^r \\equiv 1 \\pmod{N}$, then $(a^{r/2} - 1)(a^{r/2} + 1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{N}$. This means $N$ divides the product on the left, and if the conditions are met, neither term is itself a multiple of $N$, so they must share non-trivial factors with $N$. If the conditions are not met, we go back to step 2 and pick a new random number $a$. The probability of success is high for a random choice of $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2: The Quantum Order-Finding Subroutine**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the core of Shor's algorithm. It uses the **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)** to find the period $r$ of the function $f(x) = a^x \\pmod{N}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **State Preparation**: We start with two quantum registers. Let's say the first register has $n$ qubits, where $2^n$ is large enough to store the period $r$ (typically $n$ is chosen such that $N^2 \\le 2^n < 2N^2$). The second register must have enough qubits to store a number up to $N-1$. We initialize the system in the state:\n",
    "    $|\\psi_0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}} \\sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1} |x\\rangle |0\\rangle$\n",
    "    This is done by applying a Hadamard gate to each qubit in the first register.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Modular Exponentiation**: We apply a quantum operator that performs modular exponentiation, mapping the initial state to:\n",
    "    $|\\psi_1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}} \\sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1} |x\\rangle |a^x \\pmod{N}\\rangle$\n",
    "    This operation entangles the two registers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Measurement of the Second Register**: We now measure the second register. Let the result of this measurement be some value $k$. Due to the periodic nature of $f(x)$, the first register collapses into a superposition of only those states $|x\\rangle$ that could have produced the result $k$:\n",
    "    $|\\psi_2\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{M}} \\sum_{j=0}^{M-1} |x_0 + jr\\rangle |k\\rangle$\n",
    "    where $x_0$ is the smallest input that gives the result $k$, and $M$ is the number of terms in the superposition. The state of the first register is now a uniform superposition of states separated by the period $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Quantum Fourier Transform**: We apply the QFT to the first register. The QFT is a quantum analogue of the discrete Fourier transform, defined as:\n",
    "    $QFT|x\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}} \\sum_{y=0}^{2^n-1} e^{2\\pi i xy / 2^n} |y\\rangle$\n",
    "    Applying the QFT to $|\\psi_2\\rangle$ transforms the periodic superposition in the computational basis into a state where the probability amplitudes are sharply peaked at multiples of $2^n/r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Measure the First Register**: We measure the first register. The outcome will, with high probability, be a value $c$ that is an integer close to a multiple of $2^n/r$:\n",
    "    $\\frac{c}{2^n} \\approx \\frac{j}{r}$ for some integer $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 3: Classical Post-Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step is to use the measurement result $c$ to find the period $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Continued Fractions Algorithm**: We use the classical continued fractions algorithm on the value $c/2^n$ to find the best rational approximation $j/r$. Since we know the denominator $r$ must be less than $N$, the algorithm can efficiently find the fraction in lowest terms. The denominator of this fraction gives us our candidate for the period $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Verification**: We verify if this $r$ is indeed the period by checking if $a^r \\equiv 1 \\pmod{N}$. If not, we can try other candidates from the continued fractions expansion or from other peaks in the QFT output. If we fail, we restart the quantum algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a high probability of success in each run, the algorithm efficiently finds the factors of $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Cases and Significance**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Breaking Cryptography**: The primary significance of Shor's algorithm is its ability to break widely used public-key cryptography systems. **RSA**, the most common public-key cryptosystem, relies on the classical difficulty of factoring large numbers. An adversary with a sufficiently large quantum computer could use Shor's algorithm to factor the public key and derive the private key, compromising secure communication. Similarly, related quantum algorithms can break other systems like **Diffie-Hellman** key exchange and **Elliptic Curve Cryptography**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Driving Post-Quantum Cryptography**: The threat posed by Shor's algorithm has been a major driving force behind the development of **post-quantum cryptography (PQC)**. This is a field dedicated to creating new cryptographic algorithms that are secure against attacks from both classical and quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **A Benchmark for Quantum Computers**: Factoring has become a standard benchmark for measuring the progress of quantum hardware. Demonstrating the ability to factor increasingly large numbers is a key milestone on the roadmap to building a fault-tolerant universal quantum computer.\n",
