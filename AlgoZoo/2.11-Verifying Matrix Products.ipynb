    "Here is the entry for the eleventh algorithm, which shows how quantum computation can speed up the process of checking an answer.\n",

    "### 11. Verifying Matrix Products\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm tackles the problem of **verification**. Instead of computing the product of two matrices from scratch, it simply checks if a proposed answer is correct. This is a fundamental concept in computer science—verifying a solution is often easier than finding it. The quantum algorithm for this task provides a significant polynomial speedup over the best-known classical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Complexity**: **Polynomial Speedup**\n",
    "    * **Quantum**: The fastest quantum algorithm runs in $O(n^{5/3})$ time [19].\n",
    "    * **Classical**: The fastest classical **randomized** algorithm (Freivalds' algorithm) runs in $O(n^2)$ time. Note that this is already much faster than actually **computing** the matrix product, which takes approximately $O(n^{2.37})$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Implementation Libraries**: This is a theoretical algorithm demonstrating the power of the quantum walk model. It is **not implemented in standard quantum libraries**.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Detailed Theory 🧠**\n",
    "\n",
    "To appreciate the quantum speedup, we must first understand the elegant classical randomized algorithm it improves upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1: The Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given three $n \\times n$ matrices, A, B, and C, we want to decide if the equation $AB = C$ is true. This is a decision problem with a YES or NO answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2: The Classical Randomized Solution (Freivalds' Algorithm)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Naively, you could compute $D = AB$ and then check if $D=C$. But computing $AB$ is slow. Freivalds' algorithm, from 1979, provides a much faster randomized check.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Pick a Random Vector**: Choose a random $n \\times 1$ column vector $v$ where each entry is independently chosen to be 0 or 1 with 50% probability.\n",
    "2.  **Compute Both Sides**: Calculate two new vectors:\n",
    "    * First, compute $w_1 = A(Bv)$. This is done efficiently by first computing $Bv$ (an $O(n^2)$ operation) and then multiplying the result by $A$ (another $O(n^2)$ operation). Total time is $O(n^2)$.\n",
    "    * Second, compute $w_2 = Cv$. This is a single matrix-vector multiplication, also taking $O(n^2)$ time.\n",
    "3.  **Compare**: Check if $w_1 = w_2$.\n",
    "    * If $A(Bv) \\neq Cv$, we know with **100% certainty** that $AB \\neq C$. We have found a witness to their inequality, so we output NO.\n",
    "    * If $A(Bv) = Cv$, we can't be 100% certain. It's *possible* that $AB \\neq C$ but we were just unlucky and picked a special vector $v$ that hides the difference.\n",
    "4.  **Error Probability**: The power of the algorithm comes from the fact that if $AB \\neq C$, the probability of being unlucky is low. Let $D = AB - C$. If $AB \\neq C$, then $D$ is a non-zero matrix. Our check is equivalent to seeing if $Dv = 0$. The probability that a non-zero matrix will map a random binary vector to the zero vector is at most $1/2$.\n",
    "5.  **Repeat**: By repeating the test $k$ times with new random vectors, the probability of failing to detect a difference (if one exists) becomes vanishingly small, at most $(1/2)^k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple, beautiful algorithm verifies the product in just $O(n^2)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 3: The Quantum Approach (Buhrman-Špalek Algorithm)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum algorithm provides a further speedup by replacing the classical random process with a more efficient **quantum walk**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Framing as a Search**: The core task is to determine if the difference matrix $D = AB - C$ is the zero matrix. This is equivalent to checking if any entry $D_{ij}$ is non-zero. The value of an entry is given by:\n",
    "    $$D_{ij} = (AB)_{ij} - C_{ij} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} A_{ik}B_{kj} - C_{ij}$$\n",
    "    Finding a non-zero entry in $D$ is a type of search problem.\n",
    "2.  **Constructing a Graph**: The algorithm implicitly constructs a special graph whose vertices represent the row, column, and intermediate indices $(i, j, k)$ of the matrices.\n",
    "3.  **Quantum Walk**: A quantum walk is the quantum mechanical analogue of a random walk on a graph. Instead of a walker having a *probability* of being at a node, it has a *quantum amplitude*. Due to interference effects, a quantum walk can spread across a graph and find \"marked\" vertices much faster than a classical walk.\n",
    "4.  **Finding a Non-Zero Entry**: The algorithm uses a quantum walk to search for a \"marked\" item, which corresponds to an index triple $(i, j, k)$ that reveals a non-zero entry $D_{ij}$. The quantum walk is designed to evolve in a way that its amplitude becomes concentrated on states corresponding to these marked items.\n",
    "5.  **The Speedup**: The efficiency of quantum walks for searching on graphs is the source of the speedup. The intricate analysis of the walk's evolution shows that it can detect a non-zero entry (and thus prove $AB \\neq C$) in $O(n^{5/3})$ time. This beats the $O(n^2)$ classical randomized algorithm.\n",

    "### **Use Cases and Significance 🏛️**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Power of Quantum Walks**: This algorithm was a landmark result showcasing the power of the **quantum walk** as a general framework for designing quantum algorithms. It moved beyond the QFT (Shor) and basic search (Grover) to a more sophisticated model of quantum computation that is particularly well-suited for graph problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Verification vs. Computation**: It deepens our understanding of the separation between finding and verifying solutions. Not only is verification classically faster than computation for this problem, but quantum mechanics allows us to verify *even faster*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Broadening Quantum Applications**: This result is another key example of a polynomial quantum speedup for a problem already in **BPP** (Bounded-error Probabilistic Polynomial time). It shows that the impact of quantum computing is not limited to exponential speedups for intractable problems but also includes making practical, solvable problems more efficient.\n",
