    "# 1\\. Integer Factorization (Shor’s Algorithm)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Algorithm Profile**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Name**: Shor’s Algorithm\n",
    "  * **Origin**: Discovered by **Peter Shor** in **1994** at Bell Labs.\n",
    "  * **Type**: Algebraic & Number Theoretic Algorithm.\n",
    "  * **Speedup Class**: **Superpolynomial / Exponential**. It reduces the complexity from sub-exponential (classical) to polynomial (quantum).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Introduction & Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **The \"Elevator Pitch\"**: Shor’s algorithm is the most famous quantum algorithm because it breaks the rules of modern internet security. It takes a large composite number $N$ (which is incredibly hard to break apart classically) and efficiently finds its prime factors by finding the \"period\" or repeating pattern of a specific mathematical function related to $N$.\n",
    "  * **Real-World Use Cases**:\n",
    "      * **Cryptanalysis**: Its primary application is breaking **RSA encryption**, the protocol that secures web traffic, credit cards, and digital signatures.\n",
    "      * **Benchmarking**: It serves as the ultimate \"stress test\" for quantum hardware; a computer that can run Shor’s algorithm at scale is, by definition, a powerful, fault-tolerant machine.\n",
    "  * **Current Status**: It has been experimentally demonstrated on small numbers (e.g., 15 and 21) using various hardware (NMR, photonics, superconducting qubits), but scaling to cryptographically relevant numbers (2048 bits) requires millions of physical qubits and robust error correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Deep Theoretical Dive 🧠**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **The Problem Statement**: Given a composite odd integer $N$, find a non-trivial factor $p$ such that $N = p \\times q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **The Classical Approach**: The best classical method is the **General Number Field Sieve (GNFS)**. It relies on finding congruences of squares. Its runtime grows sub-exponentially, roughly as $\\exp(O(n^{1/3}))$, making it feasible for hundreds of bits but impossible for thousands.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **The Quantum Mechanism**: Shor’s genius was to transform factoring into a **Period Finding** problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  **Classical Reduction**: To factor $N$, pick a random base $a < N$. If we can find the period $r$ of the function $f(x) = a^x \\pmod N$, we can find factors via $\\text{gcd}(a^{r/2} \\pm 1, N)$.\n",
    "    2.  **Initialization**: We prepare two registers. The first (period register) is a superposition of integers $|0\\rangle + \\dots + |Q-1\\rangle$. The second stores the function output.\n",
    "    3.  **The \"Magic\" (Modular Exponentiation)**: We apply a unitary $U_f$ that computes $a^x \\pmod N$ in superposition. The state becomes $\\sum_x |x\\rangle |a^x \\pmod N\\rangle$.\n",
    "    4.  **Measurement & Collapse**: Measuring the second register collapses the first register into a periodic superposition of states: $|x_0\\rangle, |x_0+r\\rangle, |x_0+2r\\rangle \\dots$. The period $r$ is now encoded in the spacing of these states.\n",
    "    5.  **Interference (QFT)**: We apply the **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)** to the first register. This acts like a lens, focusing the probability amplitudes onto integers $y$ that are close to multiples of $Q/r$. Measuring $y$ allows us to classically extract $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Complexity Analysis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "      * **Quantum Complexity**: $O((\\log N)^3)$, or cubic in the number of digits. This is a **polynomial** runtime.\n",
    "      * **Classical Complexity**: Superpolynomial (sub-exponential).\n",
    "      * **Resource Requirements**: Requires $2n$ to $3n$ logical qubits for an $n$-bit number, and a circuit depth dominated by the modular exponentiation, which is computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Practical Advantage & Future Outlook**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **The \"Quantum Advantage\"**: The advantage comes from the QFT's ability to extract a global property (periodicity) from an exponentially large superposition in a single step. A classical computer would have to test inputs one by one to find the repetition.\n",
    "  * **Caveats**: The \"bottleneck\" is not the QFT, but the **modular exponentiation** step, which requires huge numbers of gates. Also, the algorithm is probabilistic; it might output a failure, requiring a re-run.\n",
    "  * **Future Scope**: Optimizations like \"Qubit recycling\" are reducing the resource costs. The timeline for breaking 2048-bit RSA is estimated to be decades away, dependent on the realization of large-scale Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "  * **Target**: $N = 15$\n",
    "  * **Guess**: $a = 7$ (We chose 7 because it is coprime to 15).\n",
    "  * **Goal**: Find the period $r$ of $7^x \\pmod{15}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 5.1: The \"Hello World\" Circuit (Factoring 15)**\n",

It achieves this not by \"trying factors,\" but by converting the factoring problem into a **period-finding** problem. It detects the hidden repetition (period) in the mathematical function $f(x) = a^x \\pmod N$.\n",

    "  * **Origin**: Published alongside the factoring algorithm by **Peter Shor** in **1994**.\n",
    "  * **Type**: Algebraic & Number Theoretic Algorithm.\n",
    "  * **Speedup Class**: **Exponential**. Reduces complexity from exponential (classically) to polynomial (quantum).\n",

    "### **2. Introduction & Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **The \"Elevator Pitch\"**: While factoring breaks RSA, the Discrete Logarithm algorithm breaks the *other* half of the internet's security: **Diffie-Hellman** key exchange and **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**. The problem is to find the exponent $s$ that turns a base number $g$ into a target number $y$ (i.e., $g^s = y$). Classically, this is like trying to find a specific grain of sand in a desert by checking them one by one. Quantumly, we transform this into a 2-dimensional period-finding problem, allowing us to see the \"slope\" $s$ directly.\n",
    "  * **Real-World Use Cases**:\n",
    "      * **Breaking ECC**: Elliptic Curve keys are used in Bitcoin, SSH, and TLS because they are smaller and faster than RSA keys. This algorithm renders them insecure.\n",
    "      * **Diffie-Hellman**: Used for secure key exchange in VPNs and HTTPS.\n",
    "  * **Current Status**: Implementing this is slightly more resource-intensive than factoring because it requires managing two interacting quantum registers, but it relies on the same underlying hardware capabilities (FTQC).\n",

    "$$f(x_1+s, x_2+1) = g^{(x_1+s) - s(x_2+1)} = g^{x_1 + s - s x_2 - s} = g^{x_1 - s x_2} = f(x_1, x_2)$$\n",
    "The function has a **hidden period** given by the vector $\\vec{v} = (s, 1)$. The entire problem reduces to finding the \"direction\" or slope of this symmetry.\n",

    "**3. The Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Superposition**: Prepare two registers in a uniform superposition of integers: $\\sum |x_1\\rangle |x_2\\rangle$.\n",
    "2.  **Oracle Query**: Compute the function into a third register: $|g^{x_1} y^{-x_2}\\rangle$.\n",
    "3.  **QFT**: Apply the **Quantum Fourier Transform** to the first two registers.\n",
    "4.  **Measurement**: The QFT interferes the amplitudes such that we only measure pairs $(u, v)$ that are orthogonal to the period vector $(s, 1)$. Mathematically, this means:\n",

    "    $$s \\equiv -u \\cdot v^{-1} \\pmod r$$\n",

    "  * **Caveat**: We must know the order of the group $r$. For ECC and safe primes, this is public knowledge. If unknown, we can use Shor's order-finding first.\n",

    "#### **The Classical Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "The best classical methods involve computing the **continued fraction** expansion of $\\sqrt{d}$. The period of this expansion relates to the solution. However, the period length can scale roughly as $d^{1/2}$ or sub-exponentially, making it intractable for large $d$.\n",

    "#### **The Quantum Mechanism: Continuous Period Finding**\n",

    "2.  **Approximating the Continuous**: A quantum computer is discrete. We approximate the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ using a large integer register with $N$ states, where state $|k\\rangle$ represents the real number $z = k \\cdot \\delta$ (for some small spacing $\\delta$).\n",

    "4.  **Oracle**: We apply $U_f$ to compute the ideal $f(z)$ into a second register. Measuring the second register leaves the first register in a superposition of points separated by the period $R$ (conceptually $|z_0\\rangle + |z_0 + R\\rangle + |z_0 + 2R\\rangle \\dots$).\n",
    "5.  **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)**: We apply the QFT. Unlike Shor's case where the period is an integer, here the period $R$ is likely irrational. The peaks in the Fourier spectrum will not be single sharp spikes but will be concentrated around multiples of $N/R$.\n",

    "  * **Type**: Algebraic & Number Theoretic Algorithm (Quantum Estimation).\n",

    "\n",
    "### **2. Introduction & Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **The \"Elevator Pitch\"**: A Gauss Sum is a special kind of total, adding up values scattered around the unit circle in the complex plane. These sums are \"fingerprints\" of finite fields used in number theory. Calculating them directly involves adding up an exponential number of terms ($q$ terms for a field of size $q$). This algorithm uses a quantum computer to prepare two states representing the mathematical functions and then measures how much they \"overlap\" (interfere) to estimate the sum instantly.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **3. Deep Theoretical Dive 🧠**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "We work over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Multiplicative Character** $\\chi(x)$: A function that maps field multiplication to complex multiplication ($\\chi(xy) = \\chi(x)\\chi(y)$).\n",

    "    The result is a complex number. The goal is to estimate its magnitude and phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The Classical Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "The naive approach is to loop through all $q-1$ elements, compute $\\chi(x)\\psi(x)$, and add them up. Since $q$ can be huge (e.g., $2^{2048}$), an $O(q)$ loop is impossible. Efficient classical algorithms exist only for specific cases; the general case is hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The Quantum Mechanism: Interference as Summation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm relies on a beautiful identity: the Gauss sum is proportional to the **inner product** of two quantum states.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **State Preparation**: We construct two quantum states. One encodes the multiplicative character in its amplitudes, the other encodes the complex conjugate of the additive character:\n",
    "    $$|\\chi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{q-1}} \\sum_{x \\neq 0} \\chi(x) |x\\rangle$$\n",
    "    $$|\\psi^*\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{q-1}} \\sum_{x \\neq 0} \\psi^*(x) |x\\rangle$$\n",
    "2.  **The Identity**: If we take the inner product of these two states (the \"quantum overlap\"), we get:\n",
    "    $$\\langle \\psi^* | \\chi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{q-1} \\sum_{x \\neq 0} \\psi(x) \\chi(x) = \\frac{1}{q-1} G(\\chi, \\psi)$$\n",
    "    Thus, estimating the Gauss sum is equivalent to estimating the overlap $\\langle \\psi^* | \\chi \\rangle$.\n",
    "3.  **The Circuit (Hadamard Test)**: To measure the overlap of two states $|\\phi\\rangle$ and $|\\xi\\rangle$, we use the **Hadamard Test**:\n",
    "      * Use an ancilla qubit in superposition.\n",
    "      * Control the preparation of the two states: if ancilla is $|0\\rangle$, prepare $|\\chi\\rangle$; if $|1\\rangle$, prepare $|\\psi^*\\rangle$. (Alternatively, use a controlled-SWAP if both states are available).\n",
    "      * Measure the ancilla in the $X$ and $Y$ bases. The statistics of these measurements give the real and imaginary parts of $\\langle \\psi^* | \\chi \\rangle$.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **The Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a positive integer $N$, deterministically decide if $N$ is prime and provide a certificate (proof) of this fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The Classical Approach: Pocklington’s Criterion**\n",
    "\n",
    "While AKS is the famous polynomial-time algorithm, this quantum approach improves upon a different method based on **Pocklington's Theorem**.\n",
    "To prove $N$ is prime, we need to find a \"witness\" integer $a$ that satisfies two conditions relative to the prime factors of $N-1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Fermat Condition**: $a^{N-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod N$.\n",
    "2.  **Coprimality Condition**: For every prime factor $q$ of $N-1$, $\\text{gcd}(a^{(N-1)/q} - 1, N) = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If such an $a$ exists, $N$ is prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Classical Bottleneck**: We have to verify potential witnesses $a$ one by one. In the worst case, finding a valid witness takes significant trial and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The Quantum Mechanism: Searching for a Witness**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm replaces the classical trial-and-error search for $a$ with **Grover's Algorithm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Factorization**: First, partially factor $N-1$ (using classical methods or Shor's if needed, though usually small factors suffice for Pocklington). Let's assume we know the prime factors $\\{q_i\\}$ of $N-1$.\n",
    "2.  **The Oracle**: We construct a quantum oracle $U_w$ that takes an input $|a\\rangle$ and checks the Pocklington conditions:\n",
    "      * Computes $val_1 = a^{N-1} \\pmod N$.\n",
    "      * Computes $val_{2,i} = \\text{gcd}(a^{(N-1)/q_i} - 1, N)$ for all $q_i$.\n",
    "      * Flips the phase if $val_1 = 1$ AND all $val_{2,i} = 1$.\n",
    "3.  **Grover Search**: We initialize a superposition of all possible witnesses $a \\in [2, N-1]$. We apply the Grover iterator (Oracle + Diffuser) $\\approx \\sqrt{N}$ times (or fewer, since witnesses are dense).\n",
    "4.  **Measurement**: We measure the register to obtain a witness $a$. We can then classically verify this witness to construct the primality certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Practical Advantage & Complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Quantum Complexity**: $\\tilde{O}(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of bits in $N$. This beats the best classical (AKS) bound of $\\tilde{O}(n^4)$.\n",
    "  * **Quantum Advantage**: It provides a speedup for a problem *already in P*. This is distinct from Shor's or Grover's usual use cases, proving that quantum computers can optimize \"easy\" problems too.\n",
    "  * **Caveats**: The oracle must implement modular exponentiation and GCD, which are expensive. The speedup is polynomial, so it requires a very fast clock cycle on the quantum hardware to beat highly optimized classical code.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * **Name**: Quantum Algorithm for Exponential Congruences (Multidimensional Abelian HSP).\n",
    "  * **Origin**: Generalized by **Boneh and Lipton (1995)** and **Kitaev (1995)** as an extension of the Hidden Subgroup Problem.\n",
    "  * **Type**: Algebraic & Number Theoretic Algorithm.\n",
    "  * **Speedup Class**: **Superpolynomial**. It solves systems of equations in polynomial time that require exponential time classically (e.g., Index Calculus methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Introduction & Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **The \"Elevator Pitch\"**: Imagine trying to discover a secret recipe where you know the ingredients (bases) and the final taste (the result), but you don't know the quantities (exponents). If you have multiple ingredients interacting in a complex modular way ($A^x B^y C^z \\equiv D$), finding the exponents $x, y, z$ is classically incredibly hard. This algorithm uses quantum parallelism to find the \"mixing ratio\" of these generators simultaneously by treating the problem as finding a hidden lattice structure in a multi-dimensional space.\n",
    "  * **Real-World Use Cases**:\n",
    "      * **Advanced Cryptanalysis**: This generalizes the Discrete Log attack. It is used to break cryptosystems based on the \"Representation Problem\" or \"Knapsack-like\" problems in groups.\n",
    "      * **Electronic Voting**: Some voting protocols rely on the difficulty of finding relationships between multiple generators (Pedersen Commitments). This algorithm challenges those assumptions.\n",

    "  * **Naive Method**: Brute force search over the $k$-dimensional grid of exponents. Complexity $O(|G|^k)$.\n",
